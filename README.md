🔄 Skill Swap Platform
Skill Swap is a collaborative web application built for individuals to offer and request skills from one another. Think of it as a modern barter system for learning and growth.

Developed as part of a Hackathon by Team Maze Coders, this project promotes peer-to-peer learning, community building, and skill sharing — all within a safe, moderated platform.
